dungeness harvest timing

Examines dungeness harvest by week of the fishery for the typical summer and fall seasons.
Summer season is June 15th - Aug 15th (weeks 1-9)
Fall season is Oct.1st to Nov.30th (weeks 10-18)

Some areas (fill in which ones) are open later but this is a very small amount of the total season harvest. 

Code file here summarizes catch by week of the fishery and then looks at the percentage of the total catch that is caught in the last 3 weeks of the summer season and the last month of the fall season since the 2017/18 season was closed early during this time.
